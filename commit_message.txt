fix(auth): Replace Supabase Auth UI with custom form and improve error handling

This commit addresses multiple authentication and API error handling issues:

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Removed @supabase/auth-ui-react dependency due to React 19 incompatibility
- Replaced with custom email/password authentication form

Authentication Improvements:
- Made Supabase client initialization conditional (only creates client when env vars are set)
- Updated AuthContext to gracefully handle missing Supabase configuration
- Added bypass mode for development when Supabase is not configured
- Fixed type imports for User and Session from @supabase/supabase-js (changed to type imports)
- Added proper null checks throughout authentication flow

API Error Handling Enhancements:
- Enhanced projectsApi with detailed error logging and status code detection
- Added specific error messages for 401/403 authentication errors
- Improved error messages in ProjectManager component to show actual backend errors
- Added helpful warning message in ProjectManager when Supabase is not configured
- Updated all API methods to log full error details (status, statusText, response body)

User Experience:
- Added informative error screen in Dashboard when backend requires authentication
- Improved error messages in project creation flow
- Added visual indicators for authentication requirements
- Better handling of network errors and failed API calls

Files Changed:
- src/lib/supabase.ts: Made client nullable and conditional
- src/components/Auth.tsx: Replaced Auth UI component with custom form
- src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx: Added Supabase configuration checks
- src/services/api.ts: Enhanced error handling in projectsApi
- src/components/ProjectManager.tsx: Added error handling and warnings
- src/components/Dashboard.tsx: Added API error detection and user-friendly error screen

Technical Details:
- Fixed "Invalid hook call" errors caused by React 19 incompatibility
- Resolved blank page issues when Supabase is not configured
- Improved error propagation and user feedback
- Added comprehensive error logging for debugging

This ensures the application works in both authenticated (with Supabase) and 
unauthenticated (development) modes, with clear error messages guiding users.
