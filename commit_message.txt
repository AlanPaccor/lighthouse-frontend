## Design Principles Applied

- **Minimalism**: Clean, uncluttered interfaces with purposeful spacing

- **Border Styling**: Minimal borders with opacity variations (foreground/10, foreground/20)
- **Button Design**: Architectural buttons with offset border effects on hover

This redesign creates a cohesive, professional design language that enhances
usability while maintaining all existing functionality. The comprehensive
documentation features provide users with detailed setup and integration guides
directly accessible from the dashboard.
