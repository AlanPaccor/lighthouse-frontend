feat: Add email notification settings UI and integration

Implement comprehensive notification settings interface for hallucination
alerts, allowing users to configure email preferences directly from the
dashboard.

Features:
- Create NotificationSettings component with toggle for email notifications
- Add "Notifications" button to Dashboard header navigation
- Implement modal panel for notification settings (matching Docs panel design)
- Export getAuthHeaders utility function for use across components
- Integrate notification settings API calls (GET/PUT /api/user/preferences)
- Add loading states, success/error messaging, and auto-dismiss notifications
- Apply architectural design system (minimalist, consistent styling)

Technical Details:
- NotificationSettings component handles user preference loading and updates
- Modal uses backdrop blur and architectural color palette
- API integration uses existing authentication headers
- Graceful error handling for missing preferences (defaults to enabled)
- Component follows existing Dashboard modal pattern for consistency

UI/UX:
- Clean, minimalist interface matching existing design system
- Clear description of email notification behavior (confidence < 50%)
- Visual feedback for enabled/disabled states
- Responsive layout with proper spacing and typography

Files Changed:
- src/components/NotificationSettings.tsx (new)
- src/components/Dashboard.tsx (added notification settings modal)
- src/services/api.ts (exported getAuthHeaders function)

This implementation provides users with control over email notifications
for hallucination alerts while maintaining a seamless, integrated experience
within the dashboard interface.
